Charge.  When  the  contractor  has  made  himself  liable  for  action  under  any  of  the  cases 
aforesaid, the Engineer-in-Charge on behalf of the WAPCOS shall have powers: 
(a) To  determine  the  contract  as  aforesaid  so  far  as  performance  of  work  by  the  Contractor     
is concerned (of which determination notice in writing to the contractor under the hand of 
the  Engineer-in-Charge  shall  be  conclusive  evidence).  Upon  such  determination,  Security 
Deposit  already  recovered,  Security  deposit  payable  and  Performance Security under  the 
contract shall be liable to be forfeited and shall  be   absolutely   at   the   disposal   of   the 
Government. 
(b) After giving notice to the contractor to measure up the work of the contractor and to take 
such whole, or the balance or part thereof, as shall be un-executed out of his hands and to 
give  it  to  another  contractor  to  complete  the  work.  The  contractor,  whose  contract  is 
determined  as  above,  shall  not  be  allowed  to  participate  in the  tendering  process  for  the 
balance work including any new items needed to complete the work. In the event of above 
courses  being  adopted  by  the  Engineer-in-Charge,  the  contractor  shall  have  no  claim  to 
compensation  for  any  loss  sustained  by  him  by  reasons  of  his  having  purchased  or 
procured any materials or entered into any engagements or made any advances on account 
or  with  a  view  to  the  execution  of  the  work  or  the  performance  of  the  contract.  And  in 
case  action  is  taken  under  any  of  the  provision  aforesaid,  the  contractor  shall  not  be 
entitled  to  recover  or  be  paid  any  sum  for  any  work  thereof  or  actually  performed  under 
this   contract   unless   and   until   the   Engineer-in-Charge   has   certified   in   writing   the 
performance  of  such  work  and  the  value  payable  in  respect  thereof  and  he  shall  only  be 
entitled to be paid the value so certified. 
Note:  
Actions under Clause 2 and 3 are independent.  
The compensation  under  Clause  2  is  for  loss  caused  due  to  delay  in  performance,  whereas,  the 
compensation  under  Clause  3  is  for  consequential  losses  due  to  non-performance  of  the  Contract. 
Hence, the Employer is entitled to compensation under Clause 3 and Clause 2 independently. Hence, 
the  Employer  is  empowered  to  take  action  under  Clause  2  for  levy  of  compensation  depending  on 
liability  of  Contractor  under  Clause  2  based  on  the  delay  at  the  stage  of  Clause  3  action,  before 
determination. 
 
CLAUSE 3A  
In  case, the  work  cannot  be  started  due  to  reasons  not  within  the  control  of  the  contractor  within 
1/6th  of  the  stipulated  time  for  completion  of  work  or  one  month  whichever  is  higher,  either  party 
may  close  the  contract.  In  case  contractor  wants  to  close  the  contract,  he  shall  give  notice  to  the 
WAPCOS stating the failure on the part of WAPCOS. In such eventuality, the Performance Security of 
the contractor shall be refunded within following time limits :

c)  If the Tendered value of work exceeds Rs. 10 Crore : 30 days 
 
Neither  party  shall  claim  any  compensation  for  such  eventuality.  This  clause  is  not  applicable  for  any 
breach of the contract by either party 
 
CLAUSE 4: CONTRACTOR  LIABLE  TO  PAY  COMPENSATION  EVEN  IF  ACTION 
NOT TAKEN UNDER CLAUSE 3 
In  any  case  in  which  any  of  the  powers  conferred  upon  the  Engineer-in-Charge  by  Clause-3  thereof, 
shall  have  become  exercisable and  the  same  are  not  exercised,  the  non-exercise  thereof  shall  not 
constitute  a  waiver  of  any  of  the  conditions  hereof  and  such  powers  shall  notwithstanding  be 
exercisable in the event of any future case of default by the contractor and the liability of the contractor 
for  compensation  shall  remain  unaffected.  In  the event  of  the Engineer-in-Charge  putting  in  force all 
or  any  of  the  powers  vested  in  him  under  the  preceding  clause  he  may,  if  he  so  desires  after  giving  a

money being also in the final determination of the Engineer-in-Charge) all or any tools, plant, materials 
and  stores,  in  or  upon  the  works,  or  the  site  thereof  belonging  to  the  contractor,  or  procured  by  the 
contractor  and  intended  to  be  used  for  the  execution  of  the  work/or  any  part  thereof,  paying  or 
allowing for the same in account at the contract rates, or, in the case of these not being applicable, at 
current market rates to be certified by the Engineer-in-Charge, whose certificate thereof shall be final, 
and binding on the contractor, clerk of the works, foreman or other authorized agent to remove such 
tools, plant, materials, or stores from the premises (within a time to be specified in such notice) in the 
event  of  the  contractor  failing  to  comply  with  any  such  requisition,  the  Engineer-in-Charge  may 
remove them at the contractor‟s expense or sell  them  by  auction  or  private  sale  on  account  of  the 
contractor and his risk in all respects and the certificate of the Engineer-in-Charge as to the expenses of

(a) on account of any default on the part of the contractor or;

WAPCOS, shall within ten days of expiry of such period of 15 days give notice in writing of his

compensation  on  account  of  any  profit  or  advantage  which  he  might  have  derived  from  the

abandonment. He shall, however, be entitled to such compensation, as the Engineer-in-Charge 
may consider reasonable, in respect of salaries and/or wages paid by him to his employees and 
labour  at  site,  remaining  idle  in  consequence  adding  to  the  total  thereof  2%  to  cover  indirect
